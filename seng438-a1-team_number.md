# Introduction

In this lab, the primary focus is to get an idea of what software testing is. Software testing is a critical practice used in software development, as it helps to ensure that systems behave as expected and meet their requirements. Before this lab, our understanding of testing was mainly focused on the idea of verifying correctness through pre defined test cases. However, this lab provided a hands-on experience with multiple testing styles. This includes exploratory testing, manual scripted testing and regression testing by using a simulated ATM system.

# High-level description of the exploratory testing plan

Requirements based on Appendix B:
- Withdrawals must be in multiples of $20 - will not allow decimals, must be and integer
- ATM should reject insufficient funds
- Cancel should work at many stages
- 3 wrong PINs → card retained - will display "card has been retained" and reprompt to insert card
- Deposit requires envelope insertion
- Deposit is not credited if envelope isn’t inserted
- ATM must not shut down during a customer session
- Receipt must be printed for successful transactions
- ATM logs actions (no PINs in logs)
- 4 number PIN - actually allows 22 numbers
- No letters in card number - working
- Entering PIN - Will display a blank green page when using random card number, and a long PIN. blank screen, cant go back, cant clear

High-level plan:
Based on the requirements outlined in Appendix B, our exploratory testing focused on verifying core ATM functionalities such as authentication, withdrawals, deposits, transfers, balance inquiries, and system control operations. We aimed to broadly test most system features rather than exhaustively testing a single function. Test scenarios were derived from both normal user flows (e.g., valid login followed by a withdrawal or deposit) and exceptional cases (e.g., invalid PIN entries, insufficient account balance, canceling transactions at various stages, and attempting invalid withdrawal amounts). Boundary conditions such as withdrawing the maximum available cash, performing multiple transactions in one session, and system shutdown behavior were also explored. Testing was conducted without predefined scripts to allow unexpected behaviors and defects to be discovered naturally.

# Comparison of exploratory and manual functional testing

Text…

-   Note that you need to submit a report generated by your defect tracking
    system, containing all defects recorded in the system.

# How the pair testing was managed and team work/effort was divided 

- Fatma and Amielle were assigned to work on the first pair testing for Appendix B. Fatma was testing the different scenerios that would not work and Amielle would do the recording.
